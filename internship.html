            <ul>

            <h2>Application Strategy</h2>

            <h3>Quality Over Quantity</h3>
            <p>Rather than mass-applying to hundreds of positions, focus on quality applications:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Target positions that genuinely match your skills and interests</li>
                <li>Customize your resume and cover letter for each application</li>
                <li>Research the company before applying</li>
                <li>Aim for 5-10 quality applications per week rather than 50 generic ones</li>
            </ul>
