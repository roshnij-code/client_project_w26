            <h2>Why Networking Matters</h2>
            
            <h3>Career Opportunities</h3>
            <p>Many job openings are never publicly posted. Networking helps you tap into the hidden job market and learn about opportunities before they're widely advertised. Referrals from connections can significantly increase your chances of landing an interview.</p>

            <h3>Industry Insights</h3>
            <p>Conversations with professionals provide firsthand knowledge about companies, roles, and industry trends that you won't find in job descriptions or online research.</p>

            <h3>Skill Development</h3>
            <p>Networking itself is a professional skill. You'll improve your communication abilities, learn to articulate your goals, and become more comfortable discussing your work and interests.</p>

            <h3>Mentorship and Guidance</h3>
            <p>Building relationships with experienced professionals can lead to mentorship opportunities that guide your career decisions and professional development.</p>

            <h3>Diverse Perspectives</h3>
            <p>The SI community includes people working in UX, data science, library science, information policy, and countless other fields. Networking exposes you to diverse career paths you might not have considered.</p>

            <h3>Long-Term Professional Community</h3>
            <p>The connections you build now can support you throughout your career, whether you need advice, collaboration partners, or job opportunities years down the line.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Getting Started with Networking</h2>
            
            <h3>Develop Your Personal Pitch</h3>
            <p>Prepare a brief introduction about yourself that includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Your name and program (MSI, BSI, PhD, etc.)</li>
                <li>Your area of focus or interests within the School of Information</li>
                <li>What you're currently working on or excited about</li>
                <li>What you're hoping to learn or explore (when relevant)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Example: "Hi, I'm Sarah, a first-year MSI student focusing on UX research. I'm currently working on a project analyzing accessibility in mobile health apps, and I'm really interested in learning more about research roles in healthcare technology companies."</p>

            <h3>Set Networking Goals</h3>
            <p>Rather than networking aimlessly, set specific goals such as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Connect with 3 alumni working in data science roles this month</li>
                <li>Attend at least one UMSI event per month</li>
                <li>Conduct 2 informational interviews this semester</li>
                <li>Join one professional organization related to your interests</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Start Where You're Comfortable</h3>
            <p>If large networking events feel overwhelming, start with one-on-one coffee chats or smaller group gatherings. Build your confidence gradually.</p>

            <h3>Be Authentic</h3>
            <p>Networking isn't about collecting business cards or connections. Focus on building genuine relationships based on mutual interests and respect. People can tell when you're being authentic versus transactional.</p>
